## Note to the reader

If you haven't been through the [Create an assistant using an existing bundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/2.-Create-an-assistant-using-an-existing-bundle) tutorial yet, we advise you to get started there!

## Scope of the tutorial

In this tutorial, we will build a `WasteManagement` bundle.

The bundle will be composed of two intents `trashItemInBin` and `requestBinInfo`that are described as follows:

**requestBinforItem**

* **Description** : the user is requesting about the bin he/she should throw their waste in
* **Slots**:
  * `itemToTrash`: the item the user wants to trash \(ex: banana, plastic bottleâ€¦\)
  * `binType`: the type of bin a trash might be thrown \(ex: green bin, yellow bin...\)
* **Examples of queries**:
  * _"I want to get rid of this apple, where should I put it?"_
  * _"Is this banana peel suitable for the yellow bin?"_
  * _"Can I trash my can in the green bin?"_

**requestBinInfo**

* **Description**: : the user is requesting about the kind of waste a bin type is meant for
* **Slots**:
  * `binType`: the type of bin a trash might be thrown \(ex: green bin, yellow bin...\)
* **Examples of queries**:
  * _"What can of waste can I throw in the yellow bin"_

If you are uncomfortable with intent/slot definitions, it is advised to read through [key concepts of Natural Language Understanding](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/5.-Learn-more:-Key-Concepts#3-natural-language-understanding) first.

## Diving in

Enough chatting! At this stage, we are assuming that [you have created a new assistant](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/2.-Create-an-assistant-using-an-existing-bundle#step-1-import-the-snips-weather-bundle-from-the-bundle-store).

**Step 1: Your assistant is now created, but is empty. It's now time to create the WasteManagement bundle**

![createNewBundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/createNewBundle.png)

![bundleDescription](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/bundleDescription.png)

**Step 2: Create a new intent in your bundle**

![addIntentToBundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/addIntentToBundle.png)

**Step 3: Name your intent and give it a description**

![intentDetails](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/intentDetails.png)

**Step 4: Add a slot to your intent - give it a name, and create a custom slot type**

![intentDetails](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/addSlot.png)

**Step 5: Specify the custom slot type name, options and values**

![editCustomSlotType](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/editCustomSlotType.png)

**Two options** are offered for custom slot types:

* **Automatically extensible**: if this option is **disabled**, the only values a slot will be able to have are the ones that are either tagged in the examples queries, or in the list of provided values for the custom slot type.
* **Use synonyms** : if this option is enabled, you will have the possibility to add synonyms for each provided value - synonyms will be mapped to their value in the output of the intent parser

Your slot type is now customised and you will have the possibility to reuse it in other intents. The advantage of using a custom slot type is that the provided values and synonyms will be shared across every intent of your bundle that uses it. In our case the `binType` custom slot type will be reused when building the `requestBinInfo` intent.

**Step 6: For each slot, specify if the presence of each slot is required**

![requiredSlots](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/requiredSlots.png)

If the slot is required, you must write the sentence that the text to speech system will formulate in case the slot is not in in the NLU response.

**Step 7: Add example of queries you want the system to understand and tag spans with the right slots**

![addSentence](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/addSentence.png)

Tagging is done by highlighting words with your mouse and selecting the right slot name. Sometimes, the system will suggest tags even before you highlight any part of the sentence. This feature is called _auto-tagging_.

**Step 8: Do not forget to save your intent**

![SaveIntent](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/SaveIntent.png)

**Step 9: Saving your intent will re-trigger the training of your assistant, and you'll be able to test it by typing some queries in the console and check the output**

![parseSentence](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/parseSentence.png)

**Step 10: Now head back to step 2 and build the second intent of the bundle: requestBinInfo**

**Step 11: Your bundle is now done, and your assistant is ready to be downloaded**

![downloadAssistant](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/downloadAssistant.png)

Note that at this stage you'll get a [quality indicator](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#quality-indicators) about your bundle and its intents. This indicator is here to help you know when you've added enough queries to expect a good behaviour. For complex intents with many slots, it's very important that you follow these guidelines if you want your assistant quality to be high.

### Make your assistant run on device

It is now time to get the Snips platform running on your device. To do so, please follow [these steps](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/2.-Create-an-assistant-using-an-existing-bundle#step-2-download-your-assistant).
