# Platform Configuration

Most of the configuration of the platform is done using a config file located by default at `/etc/snips.toml`. It contains various general parameters for the whole platform and specific parameters for each component. Every component first looks in its own section, then fallback on `snips-common` and finally can use a default value.

### General parameters \[snips-common\]

| Key | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bus | mqtt | transport, only mqtt is supported for the moment |
| mqtt | localhost:1883 | address:port of the mqtt broker |
| audio | \["+"\] | list of audio servers to listen to, '+' means all |
| assistant | /usr/share/snips/assistant | location of the assistant folder |
| user\_dir | /var/lib/snips | user folder |

### Audio Server parameters \[snips-audio-server\]

| Key | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| frame | 256 | number of samples per frame |
| bind | mqtt | sound streaming over mqtt or tcp \(address like 0.0.0.0:26300\) |
| mike | Built-in Microphone | name of the audio input to grab |

### ASR parameters \[snips-asr\]

| Key | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| no\_fst\_map | true | disable fst mapping |
| beam\_size | 8 | beam size |
| model | /usr/share/snips/asr | path to the ASR model folder |

### Hotword Detector parameters \[snips-hotword\]

| Key | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| model | /usr/share/snips/hotword | path to the hotword model folder |
| hotword\_id | default | identifier of the hotword to use |
| sensitivity | 0.5 | detector sensitivity \(from 0 to 1, a higher value triggers more often\) |

### Dialog Manager parameters \[snips-dialogue\]

| Key | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resources | /usr/share/snips/dialogue | path to the dialogue resources folder |
| session\_timeout | 15 | internal timeout if one component doesn't answer, in seconds |
| lambda\_timeout | 5 | timeout between dialogue and lambda for endSession, in seconds |
| retry\_count | 3 | number of times, the dialogue tries to understand what the user is saying. If this count is reached, the dialogue manager will end the session and consider that the intent is not recognized. |

### Google ASR parameters \[snips-asr-google\]

| Key | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| credentials  | /usr/share/snips/googlecredentials.json | path to the Google ASR credentials |

### Example of configuration file for one device

The configuration file can be the default one, thus all parameters are commented out:

```text
[snips-common]
# bus = "mqtt"
# mqtt = "localhost:1883"
# audio =["+"]
# assistant = "/usr/share/snips/assistant"
# user_dir = "/var/lib/snips"

[snips-analytics]

[snips-asr]
# no_fst_map = true
# beam_size = 8
# model = "/usr/share/snips/asr"

[snips-asr-google]
# credentials = "/usr/share/snips/googlecredentials.json"

[snips-audio-server]
# frame = 256
# bind = "+"
# mike = "Built-in Microphone"

[snips-dialogue]
# resources = "/usr/share/snips/dialogue"
# session_timeout = 15
# lambda_timeout = 5
# retry_count = 3

[snips-hotword]
# model = "/usr/share/snips/hotword"
# hotword_id = "default"
# sensitivity = 0.5

[snips-queries]

[snipt-tts]
```

### Example of configuration file for one main device in the living room and one satellite small device in the bedroom

The main device runs the ASR, the Hotword Detector, the NLU, the TTS, the Dialogue Manager, and an Audio Server. The small device runs only one Audio Server.

The configuration file for the main device can be:

```text
[snips-audio-server]
bind = "default@mqtt"                   # local audio server stream on default@mqtt 

[snips-hotword]
audio=["default@mqtt", "bedroom@mqtt"]  # local Hotword detector is listening to the 2 audio servers (localhost & the distant one)
```

And the configuration file for the satellite device:

```text
[snips-common]
mqtt = "<your-mqtt-server-ip>:1883"

[snips-audio-server]                    # local audio server stream on bedroom@mqtt 
bind = "bedroom@mqtt"
```

# Hermes Protocol

Hermes protocol is the set of messages and exchange of messages between the various components of the Snips Platform. The messages are MQTT messages. The figure below describes the workflow of messages during a simple voice interaction.

# Using Docker

If you prefer to install the Snips platform via Docker, here are the instructions to do it as well as some useful commands and tips to use it.

⚠️ _**Important Note**_: for the moment, the _stretch_ distribution of raspian is **not** supported, you must use the [Raspbian Jessie Lite](https://s3.amazonaws.com/snips/raspbian/2017-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip) one.

**Install Docker**

Snips Platform is deployed on the Raspberry Pi thanks to a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/what-docker). You can install it via SHH:

```text
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
$ curl -sSL get.docker.com | sh
$ sudo systemctl enable docker
$ sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker pi
```

⚠️ _**Note**_: You might need to log out and log in again for the `usermod` command to take effect.

**Create configuration dir**

```text
$ sudo mkdir -p  /opt/snips/config
```

You will need this `config` directory in the future, to put your assistant created on [https://console.snips.ai](https://console.snips.ai/).

**Download the Snips Platform**

You can pull the latest version using:

```text
$ docker pull snipsdocker/platform
```

⚠️ _**Note**_: If you get a `permission denied` error, try:

* `sudo usermod -aG docker pi`
* or log in and log out from the pi

Then you are done. The audio configuration remains the same as described [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform-on-your-Raspberry-Pi)

Once you created and added your assistant as described [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/2.-Running-your-first-end-to-end-assistant), continue below for a few useful platform commands.

**Starting and restarting the Snips Voice Platform**

You might need to stop any previous running container:

```text
$ docker stop snips
```

To start the Snips container \(provided your assistant is located in `/opt/snips/config/assistant`\), run the following command:

```text
$ docker run -t --rm --name snips --log-driver none -p 9898:1883 -v /home/pi/.asoundrc:/root/.asoundrc -v /opt/snips/config/assistant:/usr/share/snips/assistant --privileged -v /dev/snd:/dev/snd snipsdocker/platform
```

If you want to use the snips-asr-google component, you also need to mount `googlecredentials.json` account service file by appending `-v /opt/snips/config/googlecredentials.json:/usr/share/snips/googlecredentials.json`\(provided it is located in `/opt/snips/config/googlecredentials.json`\).

**Updating your assistant using command line**

Once your Raspberry is [set up](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform-on-your-Raspberry-Pi), you can trigger your assistant's upload an update directly _via_command line, without copying it manually locally on your Raspberry. Just follow these steps:

* first, copy the link of your assistant file on the Snips console \(e.g. by right-clicking on the assistant **Download button**\). The url should be of the form [_https://external-gateway.snips.ai/api/v1/assistants/proj\_XXX/download?apiToken=XXX-XXX_](https://external-gateway.snips.ai/api/v1/assistants/proj_XXX/download?apiToken=XXX-XXX).
* then, to install or update the assistant automatically, use the following **Snips** command-line embedded inside the Snips docker image:

```text
$ docker run --rm -v <CONFIG_DIRECTORY>:/opt/snips/config snipsdocker/platform snips platform update-assistant -l <ASSISTANT_LINK>
```

where `CONFIG_DIRECTORY` is your own configuration directory on your host machine, typically `/opt/snips/config`.

If there is a mismatch between the assistant version and the platform version, the update-assistant command will fail. This may happen if your platform version is too old to support your assistant. In this case, try to update the platform \(see below\). You can still force the installation by appending the `-f` flag at the end of the update-assistant command above. But beware, you may run into incompatibilities.

* restart snips-platform in order that the changes you've made take effect: [Restart Platform](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Learn-more:-Platform-Commands#starting-and-restarting-the-snips-voice-platform)

**Updating the Snips Platform**

You just need to update the Snips Platform docker container with the following command:

```text
$ docker pull snipsdocker/platform
```

# Logs

## Snips-watch

An easy way to display what the platform is doing is by using `snips-watch`. This is a program that will connect to the MQTT bus and explain the messages it sees on it.

You can install it on the pi with a simple `sudo apt-get install snips` if you already added the snips deb repositories.

By default, `snips-watch` will try to connect on the local MQTT broker, you can override this with the `-b` flag. The default output is only the detected intents, you can up the verbosity level with the `-v`, `-vv` and `-vvv` flags

```text
snips-watch -b raspi3-14.local:1883 -vv
```

### Dumping audio with `snips-watch`

`snips-watch` can also dump interesting parts of the audio stream that is available on the MQTT bus. If you provide the `--dump-audio` flag, it will dump a wav file each time the ASR detects something, as well as a 2 seconds wav of the sound before an hotword detection. With no further args it will listen on the site `default` \(which is what you want if you don't use a multisite setup\) and dump the files in the current folder. You can change this with some additional options, for example :

```text
snips-watch --dump_audio --dump_audio_site bedroom --dump_audio_path /tmp 
```

will dump audio in the site `bedroom` to the folder `/tmp`

## Enabling or disabling docker logs

If you have a bug, you can enable or disable the Docker logs by adding or removing the `--log-driver none` option when running the Docker container. Usually, the logs will be printed on the command-line, so storing them in a file with a log driver is optional.

## Display docker logs

```text
$ docker logs -f --tail 50 snips
```

# Docker logs are showing a lot of ALSA warnings

Don't worry, it's normal. ALSA has a lot of default settings that don't work with a typical setup. To remove them add `| grep -V ALSA` at the end of the docker logs or docker run command, i.e. :

```text
$ docker run -t --rm --name snips -p 9898:1883 -v /home/pi/.asoundrc:/root/.asoundrc -v /opt/snips/config:/opt/snips/config --privileged -v /dev/snd:/dev/snd snipsdocker/platform | grep -v ALSA
$ docker logs -f --tail 50 snips | grep -v ALSA
```

## Mosquitto logger

**Install mosquitto package**

```text
$ sudo apt-get install mosquitto
```

**Subscribe to all channels on the topic hermes**

```text
$ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 9898 -d -t hermes/#
```

# Using External MQTT Broker

### Standard way

You can specify the broker to use in the snips.toml configuration file. See [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Miscellaneous#Platform-Configuration).

### Using Docker

The Snips platform can be configured to connect to your own custom MQTT bus. To do so, start the Snips docker container with the `--mqtt <mqtt_server>:<mqtt_port>` option. When this option is specified, Snips' own MQTT bus Hermes will be disabled.

Thus, you will not need to expose its port through docker \(typically `-p <host port>:1883`\):

```text
docker run -t --rm --name snips --log-driver none -v /home/pi/.asoundrc:/root/.asoundrc -v /opt/snips/config:/opt/snips/config --privileged -v /dev/snd:/dev/snd snipsdocker/platform --mqtt localhost:1883
```

# Using Snips generic ASR model \(english only\)

In order to provide assistants that are light and robust, the Snips console trains a custom Language Model for each assistant's ASR. This model is limited to the vocabulary appearing in the assistant, and some built-in entities \(numbers, dates, etc\).

This gets in the way of applications that require to understand large vocabulary. General knowledge questions, for example: "What's the distance between the earth and the moon?", "Who invented the television?", etc. Robust and embedded large vocabulary ASR's are beyond the current state of the art, but if you are willing to trade robustness for generality, Snips provides you with an experimental large vocabulary ASR.

First install the packages. Be aware that it takes about 500MB once installed, 160MB to download, and about 700MB to get setup.

```text
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install snips-asr-model-en-500mb
```

Next you need to override the assistant model by the generic model: in `/etc/snips.toml`, go the the `snips-asr` section to add:

```text
model = "/usr/share/snips/snips-asr-model-en-500MB"
```

Finally restart the asr deamon:

```text
sudo systemctl restart snips-asr
```
