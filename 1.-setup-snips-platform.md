# 1. Setup Snips Platform

You can skip this step if you want to play with your assistant in the web console for now, and head directly to [Create an assistant using an existing bundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/2.-Create-an-assistant-using-an-existing-bundle). Nevertheless, if you want to run the Snips Voice Platform on a device, you will have to come back to this step later on.

### Before getting started - Requirements

The Snips Platform is currently running on 2 main setups:

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) and power supply \(see [starter kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3334)\), with at least 4GB SD card and [**Raspbian Stretch Lite**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)** installed**. You can find instructions to install it [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md).
* Android running on ARM hardware.

Additionally, you will need:

* a USB microphone \(see [recommended](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3367)\)
* optional: a speaker \(see recommended [USB](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3369) or [3.5mm-jack](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14023)\) or headphone if you want to use the dialog features, where you need to hear questions from the assistant
* you may also want to have a USB keyboard, USB mouse, and a monitor with an HDMI cable, to easily setup your Raspberry.

Have the right hardware in hand? Let's get started !

## 1. Snips Platform for Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian Stretch

Setting up the Snips Voice Platform on your Raspberry Pi 3 is a two step process:

* [Snips Platform Installation](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform#1-installation)
* [Snips Platform Configuration](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform#2-configuration)
  * [Configuring the audio](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform#configuring-the-audio)
  * [Configuring the Automatic Speech Recognition](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform#configuring-the-automatic-speech-recognition)

### 1. Installation

This section shows you how to install the Snips Platform on a Raspberry Pi 3 using the Snips Platform package installer.

#### Step 1: Configure network access

The Raspberry Pi needs internet access to pull the Snips Platform.

**Ethernet**

Plug and play.

**Wifi**

Insert the SD card in your computer and add the following file `wpa_supplicant.conf` at the root of the `boot` volume of the SD card \(do not forget to update the `ssid` and `psk` keys\):

```text
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
    ssid="<Your wifi network name>"
    psk="<Your wifi network password>"
}
```

If you're looking for more details about this step, please refer to [the official Raspberry documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md)

#### Step 2: Enable SSH

Enable SSH by adding an empty file `ssh` at the root of the `boot` volume on your SD card. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry. It will boot in about 20 seconds. If you run into issues check [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/).

You can now access your Raspberry from your computer using `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`

⚠️ _**Note**_: if you have several Raspberry Pi's on the same network, we recommend you to [change their hostname](https://www.howtogeek.com/167195/how-to-change-your-raspberry-pi-or-other-linux-devices-hostname/) or connect to them using their [IP](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md).

#### Step 3: Install the Snips Platform

This describes the installation procedure through Snips APT/Debian repository. If you prefer to install the platform using the Docker distribution, go [there](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Miscellaneous#using-docker).

```text
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dirmngr
sudo bash -c  'echo "deb https://raspbian.snips.ai/$(lsb_release -cs) stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/snips.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys D4F50CDCA10A2849

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y snips-platform-voice
```

⚠️ _**Note**_: if the keyserver `pgp.mit.edu` is down try to use another one in the 4th line , like `pgp.surfnet.nl`:

```text
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.surfnet.nl --recv-keys D4F50CDCA10A2849
```

Well, installation is done!

### 2. Configuration

#### Configuring the audio

This section shows you how to configure the audio input and output on your Raspberry Pi 3. Before you begin, plug your USB microphone to the Raspberry Pi, and connect your speaker or headphones to the audio jack.

**Step 1: List your devices**

**Audio output**

List all playback devices:

```text
$ ssh pi@X.X.X.X
$ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 0: bcm2835 ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA]
  Subdevices: 8/8
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  Subdevice #1: subdevice #1
  Subdevice #2: subdevice #2
  Subdevice #3: subdevice #3
  Subdevice #4: subdevice #4
  Subdevice #5: subdevice #5
  Subdevice #6: subdevice #6
  Subdevice #7: subdevice #7
card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 1: bcm2835 ALSA [bcm2835 IEC958/HDMI]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

Audio playback device is card 0 / device 0 \(`hw:0,0`\). Device 1 is HDMI audio output.

**Audio input**

List all audio capture devices:

```text
$ arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 1: Device [USB PnP Sound Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

Audio capture device is card 1 / device 0 \(`hw:1,0`\)

**Step 2: Select an input and an output**

Update the  `/etc/asound.conf` file accordingly:

```text
$ sudo nano /etc/asound.conf

pcm.!default {
  type asym
   playback.pcm {
     type plug
     slave.pcm "hw:0,0"
   }
   capture.pcm {
     type plug
     slave.pcm "hw:1,0"
   }
}
```

**Step 3: Adjust input and output volume**

This commands allows you to set up the sound cards:

```text
$ alsamixer
```

The sound card that regulates the output volume is the one of the Raspberry Pi. It's called `bcmX ALSA`.

The sound card that regulates the input volume is the one of the mic. Use `F6` to select this card and `F4` to play with the db gain.

⚠️ _**Note**_: if you can't change settings of your microphone it may due to the fact some microphones have no support mixer \(it is the case for the PS3Eye for example\).

**Troubleshoot your audio setup \(Optional\)**

To run this test, you need to stop `snips-audio-server` as it takes hold of the microphone:

```text
sudo systemctl stop snips-audio-server
```

Execute the following command, speak into your microphone, and hit `CTRL-C` when you are done speaking.

```text
$ arecord -f cd out.wav
Recording WAVE 'out.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
^CAborted by signal Interrupt...
```

Play the recorded sound to validate that your microphone and speaker are working. If not, you might want to play again with the db gain using `alsamixer`.

```text
$ aplay out.wav
Playing WAVE 'out.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
```

Don't forget to restart the audio server:

```text
sudo systemctl start snips-audio-server
```

#### Configuring the Automatic Speech Recognition

**Using Snips ASR**

If you use Snips on-device ASR, everything is good: we have already set it up for you. This comes free and does not require a subscription.

_**Note**_: Snips ASR only supports English and French for now, more languages are coming soon. If you need to process other languages now you can use Google Speech on the cloud.

**Using Google ASR**

You need to subscribe to a Speech Service access. Get your account and credentials file [there](https://cloud.google.com/speech/). You can have free access for a small monthly usage.

* Enable Google Speech API
* Download the credentials in json format.
* Copy this file on the Raspberry Pi:

```text
$ scp <PATH_TO_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS> pi@X.X.X.X:/home/pi/googlecredentials.json
```

* Connect to the Raspberry Pi:

```text
$ ssh pi@<raspi_hostname.local_or_IP>
```

* Move the file to the right location

```text
sudo mv googlecredentials.json /usr/share/snips/googlecredentials.json
```

* Finally switch `snips-asr` for `switch-asr-google`

```text
sudo apt-get remove snips-asr
sudo apt-get install snips-asr-google
```

### 3. Installing a demo assistant

Snips Platform is installed as a set of standard services. The services are monitored by `systemd`and they are automatically launched after installation or when you boot the system. They are also relaunched if they crash.  


To make it work, you need an assistant, we provide a demo assistant in a separate package. It will only understand queries about the weather, and stop there.

```text
sudo apt-get install snips-platform-demo
```

At this point the assistant is installed and running!

### 4. Monitoring the components

Except for sound hardware configuration, which mostly happens in `/etc/asound.conf`, the main configuration location is `/etc/snips.toml`. See the [configuration file reference](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Miscellaneous#platform-configuration) for more details.

The daemons are running by a system user called `_snips`. If you need to stop, start and or the different services, you can use `systemctl`. Here are a few examples.

* `sudo systemctl stop snips-dialogue`
* `sudo systemctl start snips-dialogue`
* `sudo systemctl status "snips-*"`

You can install `snips-watch` to monitor the bus:

`sudo apt-get install snips-watch`

then you can start `snips-watch` to know about the successful interactions. You also use one or more -v \(`snips-watch -vvv`\) to see more details during the various stages of the conversation.

All the components also send logs to syslog, so you can monitor the live debug output by running: `sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog`.

To update the platform \(and the Raspbian operating system\) just use the commands `apt-get update` then `apt-get upgrade`.

⚠️ _**Note**_: If you want further information about how the platform works, please head to the [on-device processing overview](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki#snips-platform). In a nutshell, each component subscribes to events on the bus, and publishes events based on their results, that are taken over by other components, and so on. If you want to install specific components or replace one or several component \(like the audio server or the hotword detector\) you can install packages separately. Here is the list of the packages of the platform: `mosquitto`, `snips-analytics`, `snips-asr`, `snips-audio-server`, `snips-dialogue`, `snips-hotword`, `snips-queries`, `snips-tts`.

### 5. Configuring the components

Except for sound hardware configuration, which mostly happens in `/etc/asound.conf`, the main configuration location is `/etc/snips.toml`. See the \[configuration file reference\]\(\([https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Miscellaneous\#platform-configuration](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Miscellaneous#platform-configuration)\) for more details.

## 2. Snips Platform Installation on Debian/amd64

The platform can also run on more classical machines: we provide packages built for Jessie Debian/amd64. \(And Stretch soon\).

You will need to log-on and setup Snips APT repository as follows:

```text
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dirmngr
sudo bash -c  'echo "deb https://debian.snips.ai/$(lsb_release -cs) stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/snips.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys F727C778CCB0A455

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y snips-platform-voice
```

From there you can follow the Configuration section of the instructions for the Raspberry Pi 3.

## 3. Adding Voice Capability to an Android Application

We provide an alpha version of the platform on Android in the form of an Android Library \(`aar`\). A sample project is available [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-android-demo).

### Supported architectures

We support the following architectures for Android :

| Supported archs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aarch64` |
| `armv7` |

### Add the `snips-platform-android` library to your project

#### Configure the Snips Nexus

The `aar` is hosted on the Snips Nexus, you need to add it to the `repositories` section in your `build.gradle`

```text
repositories {
    ...
    maven {
        url "https://nexus-repository.snips.ai/repository/snips-maven-releases/"
    }
}
```

_note that the Snips Nexus is using a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate, and that you need an recent JVM to be abe to use it_

#### Add the dependencies

You can then add the required dependencies to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle`

```text
dependencies {
    compile 'net.java.dev.jna:jna:4.5.0@aar'
    compile('ai.snips:snips-platform-android:0.51.14@aar') {
        transitive = true
    }
}
```

_you need to add manually the JNA dependency here, as gradle will not resolve transitive dependencies between `aar`s_

#### Exclude unused JNA libs

JNA bundles a `.so` for the `armeabi` \(`armv6`\) arch that can cause problems during the loading of the Snips native libs, so let's tell gradle not to package it in the final apk

```text
android {
    ...
    packagingOptions {
        exclude 'lib/armeabi/*'
        exclude 'lib/mips/*'
        exclude 'lib/mips64/*'
        exclude 'lib/x86/*'
        exclude 'lib/x86_64/*'
    }
}
```

That's all for the installation, see how to run an assistant in the next section

## Next: Running your first end to end assistant

You're all good? It's now time to [create an assistant using an existing bundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/2.-Create-an-assistant-using-an-existing-bundle)
