## 1. Hotword detection

Your voice assistant is listening to a hotword to know when it should start interacting with you. Hotwords are generally small phrases like Google’s “Ok Google”, Apple’s “Hey Siri”, or Amazon Echo’s “Alexa”.

Snips comes with a built-in, deep-learning based hotword detection system that responds to the keyword **“Hey Snips”**. For example, if you want to turn on the lights:

> "Hey Snips – Turn on the lights"

Snips’ built-in hotword detection is powered by deep-learning and runs on-device. It was trained to handle a variety of microphones and English speaker accents \(US\). Soon, you will be able to use Snips' console to train your own hotword detector as a service.

If you are interested by having your own custom hotword, please [contact us](mailto:contact@snips.ai).

## 2. Automatic Speech Recognition

Speech recognition is a challenging task, especially when you aim to understand wide vocabularies. Such speech recognition systems generally run on large servers, thus compromising the privacy of your users and implying costly subscriptions. They require the presence of an internet connection for your objects to work.

Snips' Automatic Speech Recognition relies on a Deep Learning model that achieves state-of-the-art performances while running on small connected devices, like a Raspberry Pi 3. Here's how we do it.

### Snips ASR

_Now available in English and French. German and other languages coming soon._

In order to achieve the highest possible accuracy on such a small device, the Snips ASR is specialised to understand the specific vocabulary and queries that make up your assistant. Hitting the download button after [creating your assistant using an existing bundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/2.-Create-an-assistant-using-an-existing-bundle) will trigger a last step of training, called language model adaptation. During this step, we specialise our ASR to your assistant, both optimising its accuracy and ensuring a low memory and computational footprint. Give it a try through our web console, and feel free to [contact us](mailto:contact@snips.ai) if you would like to know more about our enterprise solutions.

### Using Google’s Cloud service for other languages

More languages will be supported by Snips ASR in the near future: German, etc.

If you want to build an assistant today in these languages, it is possible to rely on cloud services like [Google's Cloud Speech service](https://cloud.google.com/speech), which have been integrated into our platform.

You will simply need to select it when configuring your assistant on the web console, and include your Google Cloud Speech credentials on your device \(see [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform#using-google-asr) for more details\).

Note that if you use Google’s API, you will need to pay for it after a certain point, your assistant will not work offline, and it will not follow the principles of privacy by design. We are working hard to extend our support for on-device ASR to other languages as soon as possible 😉.

## 3. Natural Language Understanding

The Snips NLU engine is aimed at parsing a query in text format. The parsing process is twofold:

1. Intent classification: the engine has to guess which [intent](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#intent) the input query corresponds to.
2. Slot filling: when an intent is detected, the engine must then extract the attributes \([slots](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#slot)\) of the query.

Let’s consider an assistant that covers the [intent](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#intent) `WeatherForecast`, and that is asked the following query:

> _"Give me the weather in **Paris**  **today** please"_

In that case:

* the [_intent_](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#intent)_ classifier_ will identify that this query is related to a weather forecast request
* the [_slot_](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#slot)_ filler_ will look for different attributes of a weather forecast request: _location_, _date_...

Given a text input, the NLU engine outputs an object with the three following properties:

* `input`: the actual text input.
* `intent`: the result of the [intent](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#intent) classification process. It contains the detected [intent](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#intent), plus a probability.
* `slots`: a list of detected slots, each slot being specified with its name, value, and span within the original query. For dates, and other [built-in slot types](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#built-in-slot-types), the value of the slot can be resolved into a directly usable object. For example, “Christmas” will be resolved into `2017-12-25 00:00:00 +00:00`.

Back on the weather forecast example, an assistant including the intent `WeatherForecast`should return the following parsed output for the query:

> _"Give me the weather in **Paris**  **today** please"_

```text
{
  "input": "Give me the weather in Paris today please",
  "intent": {
    "intentName": "SearchWeatherForecast",
    "probability": 0.8302662399999999
  },
  "slots": [
    {
      "entity": "locality",
      "slotName": "weatherForecastLocality",
      "rawValue": "Paris",
      "value": {
        "kind": "Custom",
        "value": "Paris"
      },
      "range": {
        "start": 23,
        "end": 28
      }
    },
    {
      "entity": "snips/datetime",
      "slotName": "weatherForecastStartDatetime",
      "rawValue": "today",
      "value": {
        "kind": "InstantTime",
        "value": {
          "grain": "Day",
          "precision": "Exact",
          "value": "2017-06-13 00:00:00 +00:00"
        }
      },
      "range": {
        "start": 29,
        "end": 34
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Bundle

Bundles contain all the necessary intents packaged to give your assistant new capabilities like searching for weather forecast or controlling a music speaker.

#### Store

The bundles published by the Snips Platform users are available in the Store. You can access it when you create a new assistant or by clicking on the "add bundle" button in your existing assistant page. In the Store, you can add several bundles at the same time; just be aware that adding more than 4-6 bundles may increase the necessary disk space available on your raspberry.

![confirmAddBundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/builtinBundle/confirmAddBundle.png)

The main assistant view displays the different intents of the selected bundle.

![qualityIndicator](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/qualityIndicator.png)

#### Create your own bundle

When you create a new assistant, you must either use an existing bundle, or create a new one.

To create bundle from scratch click "Create a new one" in the Store picking dialog. After naming it, you will be able to add new intents or use intents from your library in the main assistant view.

![createNewBundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/createNewBundle.png)

You may also start your own bundle by enhancing an existing bundle from the Store. To do that, add a published bundle from the Store to your assistant, then click the "Customize" button on the bundle thumbnail. A copy of this published bundle is created for you. You can safely modify as you wish, none of these changes will affect the original one.

![customizeBundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/customizeBundle.png)

#### Publish your bundle to the Store

If you have created an original and high quality bundle and are proud of it, you may want to share it with the community! It is a good practice to publish it in the Bundle Store, so that others can use it.

In order to achieve this, select your bundle and click on the "Publish" button. Please provide a good description that will be displayed to the other users in the Store.

### Intent

An intent is the classification of natural language queries into given, pre-specified use cases. You want your assistant to handle one or several intents.

For instance, the user can express the intention of getting the weather forecast at a given place and time \(`SearchWeatherForecast` intent\). This intention can be expressed in several ways, such as:

> Can I get the weather in **Paris** **today** please ?

> What are the **current** weather condition in **Paris** ?

This intent comes with two attributes, `weatherForecastLocality` and `weatherForecastStartDatetime`, that are called [slots](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#slot) \(highlighted in the queries\).

Built-in intents belonging to the same capability are grouped into [bundles](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#bundle). You can also create your own bundles — see the tutorial [Create your own bundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/3.-Create-your-own-bundle).

### Slot

A slot is an attribute of a specific intent. A slot is specified by two attributes, its `type` and its `name`. Back to the `SearchWeatherForecast` example, the intent’s associated slots are:

* the `weatherForecastLocality` slot, which has a default type \(the assistant will simply learn about it from your queries\)
* the `weatherForecastStartDatetime` slot, which has a built-in type `snips/datetime` \(for which the assistant uses a pre-trained detection algorithm\)

#### Slots types

Three types of slots can be handled by the NLU engine: [built-in](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#built-in-slot-type), [custom](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#custom-slot-type) and [default](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#default-slot-type) slot types.

**Built-in slot type**

The built-in slot type can be used by everyone out of the box. It is strongly advised to use them whenever possible, as they come with powerful built-in entity detectors.

The list of currently supported built-in slot types is available [here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#built-in-slot-types).

**Custom slot type**

Custom slot type allow you to define your own slot type. Custom slot types are meant for two major use cases:

* You want to manually specify all the values for a given slot type, and specify synonyms.
* You plan to reuse a certain slot type between several custom [intents](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#intent). Let’s assume you want to build an assistant for a restaurant. You may want to create intents such as `CreateOrder`, `CancelOrder`, … All these intents may share an `ordered_dish` slot type. Defining a common custom slot type for  `ordered_dish` allows you to extend its value list with all the utterances found in the intents that include a slot with slot type `ordered_dish`.

If you want to learn more about how to create a custom slot type, go to this [tutorial](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/3.-Create-your-own-bundle#step-4-add-a-slot-to-your-intent---give-it-a-name-and-create-a-custom-slot-type) for more details.

We're also providing a powerful feature called [entity extension](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#entity-extension) that will allow you to automatically enrich your custom slot type with hundreds of values via our Wikidata-powered tool. This feature allows you to save a great amount of time, and will prevent your from doing the cumbersome work of writing / thinking of all the possible values for a given slot type.

**Default slot type**

By default, a new slot has the `default` slot type. This default slot type does not allow you to specify values and synonyms for the slot, aside from the values that are defined in the examples of queries provided for the [intent](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#intent). If you want to extend the list of values for a [slot](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#slot), please consider creating a [custom slot type](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#custom-slot-type).

#### Required slots and dialog

In some cases, an application requires certain slots to be present for a command to be processed. This could for example be the case for a `MoneyTransfer` intent, requiring an `amount` slot. Using the web console, a user can choose to force the presence of a specific [slot](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#slot)in the queries classified as being part of a given [intent](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/7.-Key-Concepts#intent).

But what does it mean for a slot to be required? It means that if the assistant detects an intent but does not identify the required slot in the query, it will trigger the specified question to ask the user for the value of the slot \(see [this tutorial](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/3.-Create-your-own-bundle#step-6-for-each-slot-specify-if-the-presence-of-each-slot-is-required)\).
