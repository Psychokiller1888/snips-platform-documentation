# 2. Create an assistant using an existing bundle

### Scope of the tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to create an assistant using an existing _bundle_. A _bundle_ is a capability of your assistant. For example, controlling a music player, controlling the lights, or responding to questions about the weather.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to build a weather assistant. It is going to detect if the user is asking a general question about the weather, or if he/she is asking specifically about temperature, a weather condition, or the necessity to take a given item related to weather. An umbrella, for example.

Ready to start? Please log in into the [console](https://console.snips.ai/)

#### Step 0. Create and configure a new assistant

After logging in, you will be directly brought to the assistant creation page:

![Figure 1: Create your assistant](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/create_assistant.png)

**Figure 1: Create your assistant**

Please give your assistant a name. For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to build an assistant in English. Let's pick `Snips On-Device ASR` for the ASR \(Automatic Speech Recognition\), and use `Hey Snips` as a hotword.

You can now click on **Save and Continue**

#### Step 1. Import the Snips Weather bundle from the Bundle store

After saving your assistant configuration, you will be brought to the Bundle Store. This store contains bundles that have been published by Snips, or other members of the community, for other users to re-use them. They come with associated descriptions, metrics about their performances, and an indicator of how many times they have been re-used.

Please look for the `Weather` bundle published by Snips, and click on the **Add** button.

![addWeatherBundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/builtinBundle/addWeatherBundle.png)

This action will put the bundle in your cart. Now that your selection of bundles is done, please click on **Install 1 bundle**. This will take you to your assistant page, in which you will be able to browse all the bundles installed in your assistant.

![confirmAddBundle](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/builtinBundle/confirmAddBundle.png)

By clicking on the icon of the Weather Bundle, you will access the list of intents supported by the bundle. Each intent corresponding to a different scenario under which your user is intending to obtain weather information from your assistant. The Weather Bundle covers the following scenarios:

* `SearchWeatherForecast`: general weather-related questions \(ex: _“What's the weather like in Paris tomorrow?”_\)
* `SearchWeatherForecastCondition`: questions specific to weather conditions \(ex: _“Is it snowing in Moscow today?”_\)
* `SearchWeatherForecastTemperature`: questions specific to the temperature \(ex: _“Is it hot in Bali?”_\)
* `SearchWeatherForecastItem`: questions about weather-related clothing \(ex: _“Should I bring an umbrella today?”_\)

![bundleView](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/builtinBundle/bundleView.png)

For each intent, you see the number of query examples it has been trained on. The more, the better. See the Section on [Aiming for quality](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality) if you want to know more about what makes an assistant good. In this case you are ready to go, the Snips Weather bundle has already received a lot of love.

You can now test you assistant by typing queries in the right-hand panel. For example, if you type "how is the weather in paris", you should get an output similar to this:

![playWithTheConsole](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/builtinBundle/playWithTheConsole.png)

```text
{
  "input": "how is the weather in paris",
  "intent": {
    "intentName": "SearchWeatherForecast",
    "probability": 0.9649776
  },
  "slots": [
    {
      "rawValue": "paris",
      "value": {
        "kind": "Custom",
        "value": "Paris"
      },
      "range": {
        "start": 22,
        "end": 27
      },
      "entity": "locality",
      "slotName": "weatherForecastLocality"
    }
  ]
}
```

The parsed intent message payload includes:

* the original query captured by the ASR
* the detected intent, in this case the `SearchWeatherForecast` intent
* Related slots, if applicable. In this case the user wants to know the weather in a specific `weatherForecastLocality` with value _Paris_.

#### Step 2. Download your assistant

By clicking on **Download assistant**, you will trigger the training of the last pieces of your assistant, and get a `zip` file containing the configuration of your assistant.

#### Step 3.a Install the assistant on Linux

⚠️ _**Note**_ - Before going any further

The next step is to get the assistant to work on your device. If you have not been through [the on-device platform setup yet](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform), now is the time ! Come back once you're all set.

You're set? Let's run your assistant now!

* Unzip and copy the assistant folder that you downloaded from the web console to the path. Assuming your downloaded  `assistant` folder is on your desktop, just run:

```text
scp -r ~/Desktop/assistant pi@<raspi_hostname.local_or_IP>:/home/pi/.
```

Now ssh into your Raspberry Pi:

```text
ssh pi@<raspi_hostname.local_or_IP>
```

By default, this command is `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`, if you are using default hostname.

Then, move the assistant to the right folder:

```text
(pi) $ sudo mv /home/pi/assistant /usr/share/snips/assistant
```

⚠️ _**Note**_ - if you already have an assistant installed and wish to replace it, start by removing the previous one, and then move the new one in its place:

```text
(pi) $ sudo rm -r /usr/share/snips/assistant
(pi) $ sudo mv /home/pi/assistant /usr/share/snips/assistant
```

You will also need to restart Snips to take the new assistant into account, which is achieved by issuing the command

```text
(pi) $ sudo systemctl restart "snips*"
```

Now let's just check that you have the right files at the right place on your Raspberry Pi:

```text
(pi) $ cd /usr/share/snips/assistant
(pi) $ ls
assistant.json  dataset.json  trained_assistant.json custom_asr/ custom_hotword/
```

Good. You're done! Enough chattering, **let's talk to our assistant now**.

Start by saying out loud the hot words:

> "Hey Snips"

A successful Hotword detection should trigger the following events on the bus:

```text
INFO :snips_hotword: Hotword detected
INFO :snips_dialogue::dialogue: Idle Hotword(Detected)
INFO :snips_dialogue::services: Dialogue manager publish Hotword(Wait)
INFO :snips_dialogue::services: Dialogue manager publish ASR(ToggleOn)
INFO :snips_dialogue::services: Dialogue manager publish AudioServer(PlayFile)
INFO :snips_dialogue::dialogue: Current State: WaitingQuery
```

The logs above mean that the Hotword has been successfully detected, and that Automatic speech recognition is now waiting for you to talk:

> "How is the weather in Paris?"

ASR should returns the captured content, along with a few events published on the bus:

```text
INFO :snips_asr         : Listening // The assistant is listening
INFO :snips_asr::asr    : Endpoint detection. // The ASR has detected the end of your query
INFO :snips_asr         : ASR captured: "how is the weather in paris" // This is the transcripted speech
INFO :snips_asr         : Cleanup
INFO :snips_asr         : Idle
INFO :snips_dialogue::dialogue: WaitingQuery ASR(TextCaptured) // The dialog manager has received the transcripted query
INFO :snips_dialogue::services: Dialogue manager publish ASR(ToggleOff) // Toggle off ASR
INFO :snips_dialogue::services: Dialogue manager publish AudioServer(PlayFile)
INFO :snips_dialogue::services: Dialogue manager publish NLU(Query) // The NLU component is asked to parse the query
INFO :snips_dialogue::dialogue: Current State: WaitingIntent 
INFO :snips_audio_server : using output "default" for "/usr/share/snips/dialogue/sound/end_of_input.wav", WavSpec { channels: 2, sample_rate: 48000, bits_per_sample: 16, sample_format: Int } // playing end of input song
INFO :snips_queries     : Cleanup
INFO :snips_queries     : Idle
INFO :snips_dialogue::dialogue: WaitingIntent NLU(IntentParsed) // The Snips dialog received the parsed intent answer
INFO :snips_dialogue::services: Dialogue manager publish Intent("SearchWeatherForecast") // This is the actual Intent that has been parsed and is published on the bus
```

If you want a view with less logs, you can run the [display\_message code](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/blob/master/python/display_messages/display_messages.py) from the example code repository on your Raspberry Pi to display the important messages on the MQTT bus.

You can also [head here](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Miscellaneous#hermes-protocol) to learn more about MQTT Messages for the Snips platform,

#### Step 3.b Install the assistant on Android

**Use the platform on Android**

The entry point of the platform is the `Megazord` class in the `ai.snips.megazord` package. Megazord is the internal codename for the android port of the platform. The qualified name of this class may change before the stable version is released.

```text
// Instantiate the platform with the builder
Megazord platform = Megazord.builder(assistantDir) // the folder where the snips resources are
                            .enableDialogue(true) // defaults to true
                            .enableHotword(true) // defaults to true
                            .enableSnipsWatchHtml(true) // defaults to false
                            .enableLogs(true) // defaults to false
                            .withHotwordSensitivity(0.5f) // defaults to 0.5
                            .enableStreaming(true) // defaults to false
                            .build();

// register some listeners 
megazord.setOnHotwordDetectedListener(new Function0<Unit>() {
	@Override
	public Unit invoke() {
		Log.d(TAG, "an hotword was detected !");
		// Do your magic here :D
		return null;
	}
});

megazord.setOnIntentDetectedListener(new Function1<IntentMessage, Unit>() {
	@Override
	public Unit invoke(IntentMessage intentMessage) {
		Log.d(TAG, "received an intent: " + intentMessage);
		// Do your magic here :D
		return null;
	}
});

megazord.setOnListeningStateChangedListener(new Function1<Boolean, Unit>() {
	@Override
	public Unit invoke(Boolean isListening) {
		Log.d(TAG, "asr listening state: " + isListening);
		// Do you magic here :D
		return null;
	}
});

// start the platform 
megazord.start();
```

_note that there is at the moment no way to properly stop the platform, this will be available before a stable version is released. This object is in anycase quite heavy to construct so be sure you build it just once in your app_

### 3. Responding to user requests with a Snips skill

In case of a successfully matched intent, the NLU engine will publish a specific message on the bus. You can subscribe to this message \(or these messages, in case you have several intents in your assitant\) and have your assistant do the real job, like playing music, searching a weather API, or showing your best dance moves.

Subscribing to bus events with the following pattern `/hermes/intent/<name_of_your_intent>`should catch messages with the following payload:

```text
{
  "input": "how is the weather in paris",
  "intent": {
    "intentName": "SearchWeatherForecast",
    "probability": 0.9649776
  },
  "slots": [
    {
      "rawValue": "paris",
      "value": {
        "kind": "Custom",
        "value": "Paris"
      },
      "range": {
        "start": 22,
        "end": 27
      },
      "entity": "locality",
      "slotName": "weatherForecastLocality"
    }
  ]
}
```

The parsed intent message payload includes:

* the original query captured by the ASR
* the detected intent, in this case the `SearchWeatherForecast` intent
* Related slots, if applicable. In this case the user wants to know the weather in a specific `weatherForecastLocality` with value _Paris_.

You can know which slots an intent contains by clicking on the intent name in the Snips console.

From now on, responding to a user intent is simple:

* connect to the MQTT bus and subscribe to the intents of interest
* respond to each intent by parsing the slots and calling your own code, optionally sending a new message on the bus in response

The following code for the weather assistant from the tutorial is written in Python, but it is easy to adapt to [the many languages with MQTT bindings](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/libraries). You can find a few examples at [https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation)

Here we will be writing a handler in python. Before getting started, make sure you have [python + pip installed](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/software/python.md)

You can install the [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) library, if you haven’t yet done so, using:

```text
sudo -H pip install paho-mqtt
```
