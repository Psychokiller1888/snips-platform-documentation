# 4. Aim for quality

We're providing you with a set of tools to increase your assistant's quality. These tools are part of the [console](https://console.snips.ai/), and knowing how to leverage them will greatly help when it comes to building robust voice experiences.

* [Quality indicators](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#quality-indicators)
* [Built-in slot types](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#built-in-slot-types)
* [Entity extension](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#entity-extension)
* [Data generation](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#data-generation)

### Quality indicators

You might have noticed them, but each bundle and intent now comes with a performance indicator, taking the form of a coloured dot.

![qualityIndicator](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/customBundle/qualityIndicator.png)

This indicator is here to give you a hint about your assistant quality. It is strongly recommended to add more sentences to intent/bundles that are still in the red/orange quality area, until the quality indicator turns green.

### Built-in slot types

The built-in slot type can be used by everyone out of the box. It is strongly advised to use them when specifying your intent's slots whenever possible, as they come with powerful built-in entity detectors that have been specifically trained to detect these types.

Let's assume you're building an intent such as `BookRestaurant` with slots `partySize`, and `reservationDatetime`. You would specify slot types for both of these slots as being built-in ones:

* `partySize`: `snips/number`
* `reservationDatetime`: `snips/datetime`

You'll find below the list of currently available built-in slot types, including supported languages.

| Group | Name | Label | Description | Examples | Supportedlanguages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| money | money.amountOfMoney | snips/amountOfMoney | Match amounts of money | ten dollars 10$ | en fr |
| time | time.datetime | snips/datetime | Matches date, time, intervals or date and time together | Today 4:30 pm next monday at 8p.m. yesterday morning 3rd tuesday of June June 2nd at 9 pm | en es fr |
| time | time.duration | snips/duration | Matches time duration | 3 month 4 seconds 8 years | en es fr |
| numbers | numbers.number | snips/number | Match cardinal numbers | twenty-two 1.2 | en es fr |
| numbers | numbers.ordinal | snips/ordinal | Match ordinal numbers | the second | en es fr |
| temperature | temperature.temperature | snips/temperature | Match temperatures | Three degrees | en es fr |

### Entity extension

#### What is it?

When editing a slot type, you have the possibility to automatically enrich it with hundreds of values via our Wikidata-powered tool. This feature allows you to save a great amount of time, and will prevent your from doing the cumbersome work of writing / thinking of all the possible values for a given slot type.

Let's say you assistant relies on a _country_ slot, which has roughly 200 values. To ensure ASR + NLU coverage and robustness, you would have to find the entire list of countries and add manually each value directly in your slot type. The entity extension tool basically does this job for you. It takes as input some country examples and based on these values, it will suggest you different categories - along with example values - that match the provided examples. You will then be able to select the categories that best match your needs and even filter out values for each category if need be.

#### How does it work?

Our system is based on the [Wikidata knowledge base](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). We've extracted existing categories and the values belonging to each one of them. In simpler terms, the principle behind the entity extension tool is the following: each input value can belong to one or several categories \(note that some values can be missing\). Given a list of input values, the list of corresponding categories is retrieved and sorted in decreasing order according to the number of input examples each category contains. The values in each category themselves are sorted by their number of page views \(i.e. the number of clicks they generated in a given period of time\), which means that most relevant values for a given category appear first.

**Important note on the vocabulary size**: for optimal performances of the language model, we deliberately cap the maximum number of values per category to 2000, even if the true Wikidata category might contain more values.

#### Input and output formats

The entity extension input is a list of values that you consider as part of your slot type. Back to the _country_ example, a valid input would be the following:

_Input_: France, Japan, Russia

Given those three values, the system will output different categories that match your inputs. Here, something like:

_Output_:

| Category | Number of values | Matching input | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sovereign state | 352 | France, Japan, Russia | Qatar, United States of America, United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia, Germany, Russia |
| Member state of the United Nations | 196 | France, Japan, Russia | Qatar, United States of America, United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia, Germany, |
| Country | 206 | France, Japan, Russia | Qatar, United States of America, United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia, Germany, Russia |
| Member state of the Council of Europe | 23 | France, Russia | United States of America, United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, Russia, France |

The first column represents the name of the category, while the second refers to the total number of entities that belong to it. The third column tells which values, among the one that were provided as inputs, are part of the category. Note that categories are sorted based on the number of input matches, which is why the _Member state of the Council of Europe_ category only appears in fourth position. Finally, the last column provides some examples of values belonging to each category.

As we will see it in the step by step tutorial below, the different values of each category can then be displayed and selected manually. Once the selection is done, they will automatically be added to your slot type.

#### Tips

Entity extension is particularly useful to extract lists of proper nouns such as city, artist, country, etc. Basically, every concept that exists in Wikidata as a category \(called property in Wikidata\) will be a good candidate for entity extension. **Note that for proper names, capitalisation is essential**.

On the other hand, common words will be more difficult to extend since they are more rarely categorised in Wikidata. However, nothing prevents you to try it with the list of your choice.

Finally, entity extension is not suitable for entities such as numbers or dates and times, for which you must use our built-in slot types.

#### Tutorial

Let us consider an intent aimed at asking for the weather forecast in a specific country. For the sake of simplicity, we will only consider one slot, even if more slots could be considered \(for examples _city_, _state_ etc\). The detailed steps of the entity extension process are the following:

**Step 1:**

Create an intent with a proper name and description in the console.

![intentDescription](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/intentDescription.png)

**Step 2:**

Add a slot with your slot name \(here _forecastCountry_\) and create a new slot type by typing a name in the _TYPE_ section \(here _country_\).

![createSlotType](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/createSlotType.png)

**Step 3:**

A new window will then open, in which you will have the possibility to click on the **Generate Values** button.

![generateValues](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/generateValues.png)

**Step 4:**

Once you have clicked, you will be able to fill in some input values \(comma separated\) in the search bar at the top of the window. For the example, we tried three different countries \(**with capitalisation**\): _France_, _Spain_, _Russia_. When you are satisfied with the examples, press the enter button to start the categories search. This can take a few seconds before the list of categories appears on your screen.

![searchForValues](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/searchForValues.png)

**Step 5:**

As said before, the list of categories is sorted by relevance, which means that categories that match the highest number of inputs are displayed first. Moreover, each category comes with a bunch of examples aimed at helping the user to get an idea of its content. Two options are now available:

**Step 5, option 1:**

You can either choose to add the whole set of values for a category by clicking _Add this list_ for the desired category.

![addList](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/addList.png)

**Step 5, option 2:**

You can also choose to make your own selection among the list of values for each category. To do so, first click on the **Expand all** button next to the category of interest. You will then be shown the entire list of values \(paginated\) that are part of the category. In this view, you can delete some values by clicking on the cross displayed on each tab. Remember that values are sorted by page views so the most relevant ones might appear first. If you want to discard all the values below a specific threshold, just click on the entity from which you want to start dropping. All values below should now appear in red, which means that they will not be part of the final list in your slot type. When you are satisfied with your custom list, click on **Save and continue**, which should bring up the list of categories.

![expandValues](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/expandValues.png)

![expandedValues](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/expandedValues.png)

![dropPartOfList](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/dropPartOfList.png)

Note that you can add more than one list if needed \(just repeat the previous process for each desired list\). Once you have made your choice, click on the _Save and Continue_ button to save and effectively add the values to your slot type.

![saveValues](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/entityExtension/saveValues.png)

**Step 6:**

Back to the slot type edition window, you will now see the different categories you added. At this point, you will be able either to remove a whole list \(**Remove list**\) or edit its values individually \(**Expand all**\).

### Data Generation

Data Generation enables you to generate high quality and high variability training examples for your intents. It does so by using a patent-pending human-in-the-loop algorithm.

Generating data for your intents has multiple advantages, including:

* **saving you a great amount of time** shipping test versions and collecting data from users. This feature allows you to build an assistant with great performance in very little time
* **drastically increases training examples diversity** and improves the coverage and performances of your assistant
* helping you **minimize the labelling effort** as the generated data will come pre-tagged

![dataGenerationOverview](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/dataGeneration/dataGen.png)

#### Why training examples diversity matters

Training examples diversity is crucial for your end-to-end assistant performance, both at the speech recognition level \(ASR\) and at the natural language understanding level \(NLU\).

* **ASR** : a \[specialised language model\]\(link specialised LM\) is trained specifically for your assistant based on the training examples you provided. Out-of-vocabulary words can not be "guessed" in any way by the ASR. Hence, wording diversity will ensure a greater robustness to variations in formulations.
* **NLU**: the [natural language understanding](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/nlu) performance of your assistant will also improve greatly with the number of training examples provided, both for intent classification and slot-filling. If you want to learn more about NLU performance improvement expectations, we strongly encourage you to visit [our NLU benchmark](https://medium.com/snips-ai/benchmarking-natural-language-understanding-systems-google-facebook-microsoft-and-snips-2b8ddcf9fb19).

#### 1. Checklist for a successful data generation

There are a few things that are important for a successful data generation campaign, and we strongly advise you to go through each one of them.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll consider a simplified version of the `SearchWeatherForecastItem` intent and assume you want to generate 500 queries.

```text
INTENT: SearchWeatherForecastItem
SLOTS:
- weatherForecastItem
- weatherForecastLocality
- weatherForecastStartDatetime
```

**Provide clear and concise definitions for your intent and its slots**

The data that comes from data generation comes from a human-in-the-loop algorithm, meaning that there are humans operators involved in generating training examples. These people will be briefed based on the description you provide for your intent and slots, so it is very important that you provide enough context for anyone to understand what your intent and its slots are about.

```text
INTENT: SearchWeatherForecastItem: The user asks whether a given clothing item is needed considering the weather forecast
SLOTS:
- weatherForecastItem: Item of clothing
- weatherForecastLocality: Locality for the weather forecast
- weatherForecastStartDatetime: Date and/or time for the weather forecast
```

**Define your slot type and its values**

For the purpose of data generation, we strongly advise you to:

* use only `built-in` and `custom` slot types for your intent
* provide an exhaustive list of values for each `custom` slot type in your intent. To learn more about strategies to specify values for a given `custom` slot type, you can head over to [entity extension](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/4.-Aim-for-quality#entity-extension) or directly add values in the custom slot type editor

```text
- weatherForecastItem: jacket, tee-shirt, coat, umbrella, sweat shirt, ...
- weatherForecastLocality: world biggest cities shortlist
- weatherForecastStartDatetime: built-in, no values to specify

```

**Provide enough sentences**

As a rule of thumb we advise you to include each slots in at least three distinct sentences.

Back on our example, the following would constitute a decent pool of sentences to launch the data generation from:

```text
1. Should I take my [umbrella](weatherForecastItem)
2. Will I need a [coat](weatherForecastItem)[tomorrow](weatherForecastStartDatetime)
3. Do you think I can wear [shorts](weatherForecastItem) in [Paris](weatherForecastLocality) [now](weatherForecastStartDatetime)
4. I'm heading to [London](weatherForecastLocality), will I need a [parka](weatherForecastItem)	
5. Is the expected weather in [Madrid](weatherForecastLocality) for [next monday](weatherForecastStartDatetime) good enough to wear a [tee-shirt](weatherForecastItem)

```

In the utterances above, the `weatherForecastItem` is present 5 times \(required slot\), while `weatherForecastStartDatetime` and `weatherForecastLocality` appear three times each, sometimes jointly, and some time on their own.

More generally, the more diversity you provide in combinations of slots in base utterances, the more likely you'll get a great diversity and good coverage from data generation.

#### 2. Placing your order

Once you've made sure that you've followed the three steps above, you can place you order.

1. Click on the `Generate Queries` button next to the Sentences block in the intent editor page.
2. You'll then be guided through steps that summarise most of what we've seen in the previous section.
3. You'll end up on the campaign size selection page. Select the number of queries that you want to generate and click next.
4. You will be directed to a payment modal. Fill in your details \(including company details if you need invoicing\) and proceed to payment

Congratulations, you've now placed your order! Please note that your intent will remain frozen during the duration of your campaign, which will take at most 3 days \(but most times just a few hours!\)

#### 3. Following up the campaign status

You can follow up the campaign status at any time on your intent page.

Once your campaign is completed, a new version of your intent will be automatically generated and you will be able to access it from the intent page in the console. The generated training examples can also be exported using the menu button, and used on other platforms \(e.g. if you are building a chatbot\).

The campaign lifecycle consists of 4 phases:

1. **Verification**: our team will be reviewing your order and making sure that you've provided the right informations to maximise the success of your campaign. We are reviewing every campaign under 1 business day, and we'll be directly contacting you in case your campaign fails to meet our guidelines.
2. **Generation**: once your campaign has been validated, it is sent for processing by our human operators that will generate sentences for your intent. As this step involves a lot of human effort, the duration can range from an hour to a full day depending on your intent language and the size of your order. Having human-in-the loop everywhere in the generation process is crucial to ensure data quality.
3. **Validation**: on top of human proof-reading, we run our post-processing machine learning algorithms to detect and remove queries that are considered invalid. Our team has a final look at your data, and a new version of your intent gets published on the web console.
4. **Finished**: your data is ready! At this stage, you might be notified that you have to deal with a few ambiguous sentences. You'll learn more about resolving ambiguities in the next section.

#### 4. Dealing with ambiguous queries

Our validation process will take charge of removing most of the noisy data, but you might still end up with ambiguous queries.

An ambiguous query is a query tagged by our post-processing algorithm as such. Ambiguity can come from two things:

* the sentence is not properly tagged - in most cases, the tagging scheme for a given sentence is incomplete.
* the sentence is not clearly related to the required intent - it mostly comes from odd wording choices.

There are three ways of resolving ambiguities:

* If you believe that the sentence is valid, just check the box on the right
* You can re-supervise slot values
* You can partially reformulate the query if you believe it fails expressing the original intent

Our benchmarks show that ambiguous queries typically represent less than 5% of the original order, so reviewing them should not take you long. Shall your campaign have a higher rate than this, please contact us so that we can resolve the issue.

#### FAQ

You'll find below answers to some of the practical questions you might have.

**Is this feature free?**

Data generation is a paid service, you'll find below the current pricing

**How long does it take?**

We guarantee that you will receive the pre-tagged sentences you've asked for within 3 business days.

**How does it work?**

Our data generation engine is a mix of machine learning algorithms and human operators. It has been used internally at Snips for months and so is extensively tested \(this is the process that is behind our [benchmark data](https://github.com/snipsco/nlu-benchmark) for instance\).

**What quality guarantee do I have?**

Each of the generated sentence is reviewed manually by several people. This allows us to guarantee a high quality level. Our service also includes a disambiguation algorithm that is responsible of identifying problematic queries. In case some queries remain ambiguous after these rounds of validation, you might be asked to manually address these ambiguities. Ambiguous sentences should not represent more than 5% of the order size, so if it does, get in touch and we will resolve it.

If you have any other question or remark regarding this feature, do not hesitate to \[contact us\]\(contact us link\), we will do our best to answer your needs.
