The new release of the Snips Platform contains many improvements regarding Dialogue handling. The Dialogue Manager is the component responsible for back and forth interactions between the _assistant_ and the _user_.

In the previous version, the only possible customization of the dialogue was to specify which _slots_ in an intent were mandatory for an intent to be considered as valid by the Dialogue Manager. From the console, the developer was able to add the questions that the assistant should ask in case these mandatory slots were missing in the user query. In such cases, the Dialogue Manager was waiting until the user gave a valid answer.

This mandatory slot feature is still supported, and on top of that, the new Dialogue Manager offers the developer powerful new features to conceive far more complex interactions between the assistant and the user:

* Each full intent parsing now takes place in a dialogue _session_ with a unique _sessionID_.
* The client can now trigger a new dialogue session without emulating a _hotword detected_message.
* The handler code can decide to continue or to end a session. In addition, at each step of the session in which the Dialogue Manager waits for a user query, the handler code can specify the list of intents it is expecting to receive.
* The platform supports the notion of siteId to track sessions with different input/output \(for support for multiple room for example\).
* Only one session can run per _siteId_, but these sessions can run concurrently.

## Sessions

A session is the full verbal exchange between the platform and the user to determine an intent.

![Figure 1: Typical dialogue session](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/dialogue/Figure1.png)

**Figure 1: Typical dialogue session**

Figure 1 shows how a classical session happened:

* An event starts the session, typically it can be when the hotword is detected, or a button is pressed and the client sends the `startSession` message on the MQTT bus.
* The Dialogue Manager will keep the session alive and ask for missing slots until the user provides them or cancels the order.
* Finally the complete intent is sent to the handler code

![Figure 2: Session started by the client](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/dialogue/Figure2.png)

**Figure 2: Session started by the client**

The session can also be started by the client code itself, as shown in the first step of Figure 2. The client code can also end the session with the `endSession` message immediately after getting its expected intent. If it doesn’t send such end message, the Dialogue Manager will end the session automatically after a timeout of few seconds \(the duration of this timeout can be configured in the config file\).

## Multi-turn dialogue

![Figure 3: Conversational session](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/dialogue/Figure3.png)

**Figure 3: Conversational session**

Snips platform 2.0 includes support for conversations with back and forth communication between the Dialogue Manager and the client code. This conversation is wrapped into the same session. The client decides when the session should continue or end according to the intent\(s\) it received from the platform. Figure 3 shows an example of conversation about booking a flight:

* The user invokes the platform with the hotword, and starts to express its intention to book a flight
* The client code gets the intent and needs to disambiguate the starting airport of the flight, thus it will ask the Dialogue Manager to continue the session, and provide the question to ask to the user, with the kind of answer it expects \(the name of the intent\(s\) to use to analyze the user answer\). In our case it is an intent that knows about airport names.
* Without having to invoke the platform again with the hotword, the user gave his answer and the client code can verify the airport name is part of the expected ones \(_Roissy_ or _Orly_\). It can follow up and ask for more informations like time, date etc.
* Once the client code has all the necessary information, it can end the session with the `endSession` message, with an optional feedback text message.

## Multi-room dialogue

The Snips Platform 2.0 also has support for multiple audio input/output. It supports configurations with one device running all the components of the platform and several smaller devices running only the audio server for audio I/O. These little devices can be distributed in various rooms of a house, for example \(see Figure 4\). The main one can handle several concurrent interactions, coming from various audio servers, without loosing the context. The way it works at the protocol level is described in Figure 4. Here we have two audio servers, one in the bedroom, one in the kitchen, and the main one \(the ”Hub” device\) running the hotword detector, the ASR, the Dialogue Manager and the Handler code is in the living room. To be distinguished, each audio server has an identifier, a _siteId_; in our case these are ”bedroom” and ”kitchen”. Each audio server streams audio frames to the hotword detector, and ASR in the main device.

* The woman says the hotword in the bedroom
* The hotword detector in the Hub detects the hotword in the audio stream coming from the audio server ”bedroom”, thus it posts a _detected message_, with the ”bedroom” siteId in the payload of the message.
* The Dialogue Manager handles the conversation, the ASR for this session will also use the voice coming from audio server with the same _siteId_ \(”bedroom”\).
* At the end, the Dialogue Manager will post the `intent/\<intentName>` message for the Handler code with the original siteId in the payload of the message.

![Figure 4: Multi-rooms support](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/images/dialogue/Figure4.png)

**Figure 4: Multi-rooms support**

Note that the hotword detector also has an ID that identifies it. In the previous example, it is just default because there is only one detector but if you prefer to have a hotword detector component embedded in each audio source, to minimize energy consumption, for example, the configuration will look like the one represented in Figure 5.

## Triggering interactions with your user

At any time, your handler code can trigger a `startSession` message on the MQTT bus. You can learn more about that in the [message reference documentation](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/5.-Build-rich-interactions#hermesdialoguemanagerstartsession) below.

## Messages reference

### _hermes/intent/&lt;intentName&gt;_

This is the main message the handler code should subscribe to. It is sent by the Dialogue Manager when an intent has been detected. Handler code can subscribe to a specific kind of intent \(with _intentName_ or to all detected intents\). The payload of the message contains the following informations:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | _String_ - Session of the intent detection. The client code must use it to continue or end the session. |
| customData | _Optional String_ - Custom data provided in the start session request on `hermes/dialogueManager/startSession` |
| siteId | _String_ - Site where the user interaction took place |
| input | _String_ - The user input that has generated this intent |
| intent | _JSON Object_ - Structured description of the intent classification |
| slots | _Optional Array of JSON Objects_ - Structured description of the detected slots for this intent if any |

### _hermes/dialogueManager/startSession_

This message can be sent by the handler code to programmatically initiate a new session. The Dialogue Manager will start the session by asking the TTS to say the text \(if any\) and wait for the answer of the end user. The message payloads can contain the following parameters:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| siteId | _Optional String_ - Site where the user started the interaction. |
| init | _JSON Object_ - Session initialisation description: Action or Notification. See below  |
| customData | _Optional String_ - Additional information that can be provided by the handler. Each message related to the new session - sent by the Dialogue Manager - will contain this data |

**Session Initialisation: Action**

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | _"action"_ |
| text | _Optional String_ - Text that the TTS should say at the beginning of the session. |
| canBeEnqueued | _Boolean_ - if true, the session will start when there is no pending one on this siteId, if false, the session is just dropped if there is running one. |
| intentFilter | _Optional Array of Strings_ - A list of intents names to restrict the NLU resolution on the first query. |

**Session Initialisation: Notification**

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | _"notification"_ |
| text | _String_ - Text the TTS should say |

### _hermes/dialogueManager/sessionQueued_

This is a message that the handler code can subscribe to. It is sent by the Dialogue Manager when it receives a `startSession` message and the corresponding site is busy. Only `startSession` messages with a notification initialisation or an action initialisation with canBeEnqueued to true can be enqueued. When the site is free again, this session will be started.

The payload of the message contains the following informations:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | _String_ - Session identifier that was enqueued |
| siteId | _String_ - Site where the user interaction will take place |
| customData | _Optional String_ - Custom data provided in the start session request on `hermes/dialogueManager/startSession` |

### _hermes/dialogueManager/sessionStarted_

This is a message that the handler code can subscribe to. It is sent by the Dialogue Manager when it receives a startSession message and the corresponding site is free.

The payload of the message contains the following informations:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | _String_ - Session identifier that was started  |
| siteId | _String_ - Site where the user interaction is taking place |
| customData | _Optional String_ - Custom data provided in the start session request on `hermes/dialogueManager/startSession` |

### _hermes/dialogueManager/continueSession_

After the handler code received an `hermes/intent/\<intentName>` message and want to continue the session. It can send a continuation message to the Dialogue Manager passing the same sessionID as parameter.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | _String_ - Session identifier to continue. |
| text | _String_ - The text the TTS should say to start this additional request of the session. |
| intentFilter | _Optional Array of String_ - A list of intents names to restrict the NLU resolution on the answer of this query. |

If _intentFilter_ contains unknown intent names, the NLU will post an error message and the session will be closed.

### _hermes/dialogueManager/endSession_

When the handler received the intents it needs, or when the handler wants to explicitly end a running session, it should send this `endSession` message with the given _sessionId_.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | _String_ - Session identifier to end. |
| text | _Optional String_ - The text the TTS should say to end the session. |

If the text is null, the Dialog Manager will immediately send a `endedSession` message after receiving this message, otherwise, the endedSession will be sent after the text is said.

### _hermes/dialogueManager/sessionEnded_

This is a message that the handler code can subscribe to. It is sent by the Dialogue Manager the session is ended.

The payload of the message contains the following informations:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | _String_ - Session identifier of the ended session. |
| customData | _Optional String_ - Custom data provided in the start session request on `hermes/dialogueManager/startSession` |
| siteId | _String_ - Site where the user interaction took place |
| termination | _JSON Object_ - Structured description of why the session has been ended. See below |

**Session Termination Type**

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reason | _String_ - the reason why the session was ended  |
| error | _Optional String_ - Error description if an error occurs during the session |

A session can be ended for these reasons:

* _nominal_: the session ended as expected \(a `endSession` message was received\).
* _abortedByUser_: the session aborted by the user.
* _intentNotRecognized_: the session ended because no intent was successfully detected.
* _timeout_: The session timed out because no response from one of the components or no `endSession` message from the handler code was received in a timely manner
* _error_: The session failed with an error
